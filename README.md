Short Introduction:
I am Lorenzo Vergel de Dios, an aspiring Web Developer. I graduated in the University of Santo Tomas. I've been in the sales industry for the past 4 years. Recently, I've decided to pursue a different career path and use the degree that I have to start my career in the Tech Industry.

My Hobbies:
During my freetime I usually workout, swim or play mobile legends with my siblings.

My Goals for this year:
This year I would like to pass HTML, CSS and JavaScript in my linked in account.

Resons why I want to be a Web Developer:
I want to become a good web developer because I want to have a developer job in America next year. My fiance is currently living in America and I plan to work there for the next 5 years. Upon checking the jobs that I can apply for, web development catched my attention the most because I get to build web applications remotely.
